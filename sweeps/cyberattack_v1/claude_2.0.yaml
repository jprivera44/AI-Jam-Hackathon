    value: "Hackers launched a covert malware attack on critical facilities at Blue's military bases near Green's borders, according to a major tech company and Blue's intelligence agencies. A significant Blue military base, along with its ports and airfields, would be vital in responding to any conflict in or around Green's region. This major tech company has identified a group, believed to be sponsored by Green's government, that has been conducting an extensive hacking campaign targeting crucial systems in Blue's territories and its military bases for the past two years. These systems included communications, manufacturing, utilities, construction, and transport. While the current activities of this group seem to have focused on gathering intelligence, given that they haven't used their access to destroy data or launch attacks, the tech company cautioned that their focus on such strategic areas might pave the way for future disruptions. Green responded that the statements by the tech company were false and unprofessional."
