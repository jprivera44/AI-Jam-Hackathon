    value: "From the north, east, and south, Orange launched an aggressive assault on its adjacent nation, Purple, bombarding over twelve cities and striking military installations. The assault resulted in the death of at least 500 Purple military personnel and civilians. The conflict started at dawn on day 1, with Orange coordinating both land and air offensives, including extensive air and missile attacks throughout Purple. Some of these projectiles penetrated deep into Purple territory. Orange's leader cautioned other nations against intervention, emphasizing Orange's potent nuclear capabilities. According to Orange, this action was taken to counter what it perceives as a significant threat from Purple they claim is influenced by a fascist ideology, allegedly fostered by Blue. However, this is Orange's viewpoint and the accuracy of their justification can be questioned."
