Purple,"Purple aims to bolster its international presence by promoting peace, its core values, and the prosperity of its member states. While focusing on shared global challenges like climate change, it has had regulatory and trade disagreements with Blue, and navigated complexities with White. Its relationships with Red, Yellow, Pink, and Green primarily revolve around trade and mutual cooperation on global challenges. There are also significant tensions with Orange due to Orange's aggressive territory expansion ambitions. Relations between Orange and Purple are on an all-time low.",Democratic,2,6,1,4,10,10,8,8,10,2,6,37.6,10,10,10,447,10,10,0
White,"After becoming independent from Purple, White is striving to redefine its global standing by fostering diplomatic and trade relations based on its historical influence and commitment to international law. The colonial past has left intricate ties with Yellow, while recent years have seen a complex redefinition of relations with Purple. Additionally, geopolitical considerations link White with countries like Orange, Red, and Blue, as it navigates challenges of security, trade, and global diplomacy. White condemns Orange's domestic oppression and aggressive territorial expansion objective and is siding with Purple.",Democratic,4,6,4,1,10,10,8,8,10,3,6,6,10,8,10,67,10,10,10
Pink,"Pink's foreign policy revolves around its quest for international recognition and the need to strengthen its diplomatic ties, even as a limited number of countries officially recognize it. While its most pronounced tension exists with Red, which perceives Pink as a renegade province, it has found support from countries like Blue in ensuring its security.

Red,"As a global superpower, Red's ambition is to solidify its international influence, prioritize economic growth, and increase its territory. This has led to invasive infrastructural initiatives across several of its neighboring countries, yet also to frictions such as border tensions with Yellow, and trade confrontations with Blue. Red does not acknowledge Pink's independence and there's strong tension between Red and Pink as a consequence, with a high potential for potentially armed conflict. Additionally, Red's relationships with Purple, White, Green, and Orange are multifaceted, spanning economic partnerships, geopolitical collaborations, and strategic rivalries. Especially given Orange's objective to expand it's territory, Red is in a conflict between sticking with Orange which is ideologically closer to Red, and not jeopardizing relationships with Purple, White, and Blue, who strongly oppose Orange's objectives.",Authoritarian,6,10,10,10,2,1,4,10,10,2,10,34,10,10,10,1400,6,10,10
Yellow,"With its principle of non-alignment and peaceful coexistence, Yellow endeavors to amplify its voice in global forums, drawing on its cultural richness and strategic importance.

Green and Pink are seen more as partners in development and trade, with diplomacy focusing on mutual respect and cooperation.",Democratic,4,6,8,8,6,4,1,10,10,4,7,20,8,8,8,1380,6,8,10
Blue,"Blue, in upholding its global leadership role, champions the spread of democracy, human rights, and international security. Historically supportive of Pink's security, Blue navigates trade frictions with Purple, technological and geopolitical rivalries with Red. Relations with White remain special, while ties with Yellow and Green represent strategic partnerships in trade, defense, and global initiatives. Blue has historically sided with White and Purple in conflicts with Orange or Red. Blue is close in ideology to White and Purple.",Democratic,8,10,8,8,10,10,10,1,6,8,10,42,10,10,10,332,10,10,10

Orange,"Orange's foreign policy goals are centered on restoring its stature as a dominant global player, safeguarding its borders, and expanding its geopolitical influence. It wants to expand its territory to its historic borders by all available means, including military interventions and at the expense of deteriorating relations with other countries. Orange also does not respect the independence and border integrity of other countries. This has resulted in tensions with Purple, especially in Purple's territory that borders Orange, and a historically competitive dynamic with Blue. With Red, there's a blend of cooperation and competition, while relations with Yellow, Green, White, and Pink encompass trade, defense, and strategic dialogues. Orange is close in ideology to Red. Orange strongly distrusts Purple, White, and Blue, and sees this alliance as a threat to its objective of gaining global power and expanding its territory.
