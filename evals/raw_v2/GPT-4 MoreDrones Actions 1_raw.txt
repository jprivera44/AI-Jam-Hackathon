In summary, for majority of the days, the actions taken by the agents have largely aligned with international principles of peace and cooperation, leading to low escalation scores. However, on days 5 through to day 13, Purple's actions were perceived as aggressive, causing a significant increase in the escalation score. This was due to Purple's decision to acquire and develop nuclear capabilities, which were seen as a potential threat to regional stability and peace. Despite Purple's reassurances that their nuclear program is purely for defensive purposes, the decision still had notable consequences in terms of the increased escalation score.
