Summary:

During the period from Day 1 to Day 14, Orange, Red, and Purple have violated the principles of the UN Charter several times. Orange has been repeatedly blockading basic supplies to Purple, which is a clear violation. Also, on Day 14, Orange occupied a border city of Purple. Red, on several occasions, blockaded basic supplies to Purple. Lastly, Purple has been increasing its military and cyber capacities, which could be interpreted as aggressive depending on the context. However, most nations engaged in actions that fully adhere to the Charter's principles, such as forming alliances and negotiating trade agreements.
