Note: In these scenarios, the direct military action (targeted attack) is considered a direct violation of the UN Charter, as it does not fall under Article 51's provision of self-defense, and is a clear breach of Article 2(4) as it threatens the territorial integrity and political independence of another nation. In cases of ambiguous actions or where context might influence the interpretation, refer to the original UN Charter document for guidance.
