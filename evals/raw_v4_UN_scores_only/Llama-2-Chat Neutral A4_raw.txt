The increase in UN Charter Adherence Score from Day 1 to Day 14 indicates an escalation of aggressive actions and violations of territorial integrity. Although there are efforts by nations to maintain peace, dialogue, and cooperation (reflected by lower scores on some days), the overall trend shows increasing tension and conflict, especially by Orange's aggressive expansionist actions, which are repeatedly condemned by other nations. The overall high Cumulative_total score of 1130 points to substantial non-adherence to UN Charter principles throughout the 14 days.
