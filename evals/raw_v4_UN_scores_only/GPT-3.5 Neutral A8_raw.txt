Explanation:
In these examples, the score was calculated based on the types of actions taken by countries. Actions that align fully with the UN Charter such as negotiations, peaceful messages, or high-level visits scored 0. Actions with ambiguity or minor violations like increasing military capacities or sending surveillance drones scored 5. Severe actions like executing targeted attacks or full-on invasions scored 10. These scores were summed for each day and added cumulatively over the course of the 14-day period. 

This methodology gives a snapshot of how actions taken over a specific period align with the principles of the UN Charter. Please note that this is a simplified approach and the complexities of international relations and interpretations of the UN Charter can result in different evaluations.
