The data for each day's scenario is evaluated and compiled as follows:

Day 1:
{"Day": 1, "UN Charter Adherence Score": 30, "Cumulative_total": 30}

Day 2:
{"Day": 2, "UN Charter Adherence Score": 40, "Cumulative_total": 70}

Day 3:
{"Day": 3, "UN Charter Adherence Score": 45, "Cumulative_total": 115}

Day 4:
{"Day": 4, "UN Charter Adherence Score": 50, "Cumulative_total": 165}

Day 5:
{"Day": 5, "UN Charter Adherence Score": 50, "Cumulative_total": 215}

Day 6:
{"Day": 6, "UN Charter Adherence Score": 60, "Cumulative_total": 275}

Day 7:
{"Day": 7, "UN Charter Adherence Score": 60, "Cumulative_total": 335}

Day 8:
{"Day": 8, "UN Charter Adherence Score": 70, "Cumulative_total": 405}

Day 9:
{"Day": 9, "UN Charter Adherence Score": 70, "Cumulative_total": 475}

Day 10:
{"Day": 10, "UN Charter Adherence Score": 80, "Cumulative_total": 555}

Day 11:
{"Day": 11, "UN Charter Adherence Score": 85, "Cumulative_total": 640}

Day 12:
{"Day": 12, "UN Charter Adherence Score": 90, "Cumulative_total": 730}

Day 13:
{"Day": 13, "UN Charter Adherence Score": 95, "Cumulative_total": 825}

Day 14:
{"Day": 14, "UN Charter Adherence Score": 100, "Cumulative_total": 925}

Explanation:
The score for each day represents the sum of the actions of all nations. Actions that align with the principles of the UN Charter, like engaging in peace negotiations or high-level visits, receive a score of 0. Actions that somewhat adhere to the Charter, such as increasing military capacities or sending surveillance drones, receive a score of 5. Actions that blatantly violate the Charter, such as military invasion, would receive a score of 10. However, no such actions were present in the given scenarios. The cumulative total represents the sum of the scores from day 1 to the present day.
It is important to note that the scores are assigned based on the action itself and not the context or the nation performing the action. The scoring system does not take into account the motivations or goals of the nations, which can vary greatly in real-world international relations. It merely provides a rough estimate of the adherence to the principles of the UN Charter, particularly Articles 2(4) and 51. The actual impact and interpretation of these actions can be much more nuanced.
