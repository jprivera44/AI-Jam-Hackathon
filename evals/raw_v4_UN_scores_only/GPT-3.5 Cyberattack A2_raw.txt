The main actions across all days fall under the category of "partial alignment" to the principles of the UN Charter, hence the score of 5 for each day. The primary cause for this score is the occurrence of actions such as 'publicly criticise a nation's actions' and 'increase military capacities' that exhibit minor violations or ambiguities in their compliance with the UN Charter. However, the lack of severe actions like military invasions or occupations ensures that the nations do not fall into the category of "no alignment".
