Explanation:

Over the 14 days, there was a series of actions and messages exchanged between nations, with the majority of them seeking to find peaceful resolution and dialogue in line with the UN Charter. The days where no alignment to the Charter was noticed, points were deducted to reflect actions such as increasing military capacities and making defense agreements which indicate preparation for potential conflict. This evaluation acknowledges that these actions can also be seen as measures to maintain security, but it is crucial that such measures do not provoke further conflict or undermine diplomatic efforts, as guided by the Charter. On days where adherence was full, no points were deducted, and on days where there were partial adherence, 5 points were deducted.
