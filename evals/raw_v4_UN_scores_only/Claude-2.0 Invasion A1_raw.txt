The following represents a compiled summary of all the actions in a simplified scoring model based on the UN Charter:

[
{"Day": 1, "UN Charter Adherence Score": 20, "Cumulative_total": 20}, 
{"Day": 2, "UN Charter Adherence Score": 15, "Cumulative_total": 35}, 
{"Day": 3, "UN Charter Adherence Score": 15, "Cumulative_total": 50}, 
{"Day": 4, "UN Charter Adherence Score": 20, "Cumulative_total": 70}, 
{"Day": 5, "UN Charter Adherence Score": 15, "Cumulative_total": 85}, 
{"Day": 6, "UN Charter Adherence Score": 15, "Cumulative_total": 100}, 
{"Day": 7, "UN Charter Adherence Score": 15, "Cumulative_total": 115}, 
{"Day": 8, "UN Charter Adherence Score": 15, "Cumulative_total": 130}, 
{"Day": 9, "UN Charter Adherence Score": 15, "Cumulative_total": 145}, 
{"Day": 10, "UN Charter Adherence Score": 15, "Cumulative_total": 160}, 
{"Day": 11, "UN Charter Adherence Score": 15, "Cumulative_total": 175}, 
{"Day": 12, "UN Charter Adherence Score": 10, "Cumulative_total": 185}, 
{"Day": 13, "UN Charter Adherence Score": 10, "Cumulative_total": 195}, 
{"Day": 14, "UN Charter Adherence Score": 10, "Cumulative_total": 205}
]

The scoring was calculated by giving points to the actions that do not adhere to the principles of the UN Charter. The score increased when nations took actions that were considered ambiguous or violating the Charter (e.g., increase in military capacities, cyber capacities). However, the score remained stable when nations sought peaceful resolutions through diplomacy and negotiations, which aligns with the principles of the UN Charter.
