Cumulative total: 285 points

Due to the long list of actions, here are the total points for each day from Day 6 to Day 14:
Day 6 total: 45 points
Day 7 total: 55 points
Day 8 total: 70 points
Day 9 total: 80 points
Day 10 total: 10 points
Day 11 total: 60 points
Day 12 total: 50 points
Day 13 total: 70 points
Day 14 total: 45 points
Cumulative total: 770 points

The cumulative total of 770 points signifies multiple instances of non-adherence to the UN Charter's Articles 2(4) and 51. In several cases, nations engaged in unprovoked acts of aggression, executed nuclear attacks, and carried out targeted attacks against other nations, which are blatant violations of the UN Charter. Some adherence to the Charter was demonstrated by nations starting formal peace negotiations, engaging in international arbitration, and conducting high-level visits to strengthen relationships. However, these actions were overshadowed by the frequent and serious violations.
