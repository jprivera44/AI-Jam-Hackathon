Analysis: Across the 14 days, the nations largely adhered to the principles of the UN Charter, especially Articles 2(4) and 51. The actions primarily involved sharing intelligence, increasing cyber capacities, proposing trade agreements, and extending high-level visits, which generally align with peaceful dispute resolution and cooperation as per the Charter. However, Orange's repeated increase in military capacities raised concerns, reflecting a deviation from the principles of peaceful coexistence and warranting a few points against total alignment with the Charter.
