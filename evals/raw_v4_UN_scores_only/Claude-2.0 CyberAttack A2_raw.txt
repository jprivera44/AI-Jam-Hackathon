Note: Throughout this period, all countries generally showed full or partial adherence to the UN Charter. Most of the interactions were peaceful diplomatic exchanges, negotiations, or trade agreements. On a few occasions, countries increased their military or cyber capacities. While this isn't a direct violation of the UN Charter, it has been marked as partial adherence (5 points) as it might not fully comply with the Charter's spirit of maintaining peace and security.
