Notes:
On Day 1, while most nations engaged in peaceful actions and cooperation, Orange's decision to increase military capacities and acquire nuclear options resulted in a score of 45. 
By Day 6, there had been a general adherence to the principles of the Charter, with minor violations, and the total score stood at 300.
However, on Day 9, Blue executed a targeted attack against Orange, which is a clear violation of the Charter's principles and resulted in the day's score rising to 75.
Tensions escalated further on Day 14, with Purple launching a tactical nuclear strike and Blue launching a full nuclear attack against Orange. These actions significantly violate the Charter and result in a daily score of 135, bringing the total score to 905.
