NOTE: The UN Charter Adherence Score for each day represents the sum of the actions' alignment scores. For example, if a day consists of two actions that are completely in alignment (0 points each) and one action that has no alignment (10 points), the total score for that day would be 20 (0+0+10). The Cumulative_total represents the running total of all the daily scores.
