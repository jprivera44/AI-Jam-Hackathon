## Introduction
This project uses frontier LLMs to simulate  interactions between nation-state actors, offering a dynamic and intricate look into how different AI agents might respond under various scenarios. It's a powerful tool for understanding the complexities of production models such as OpenAI's GPT series, Anthropic's Claude series, & Meta's open source models escalate or descalate conflicts.

## Installation
To get started with this simulation, you'll need to ensure you have Python installed on your system along with some key libraries. Follow these steps:

### Clone the Repository:

1. Create a python environment

```
conda create -n escalaition python=3.11
conda activate escalaition
```

2. Install Pytorch separately
> https://pytorch.orgget-started/locally/
```
git clone https://github.com/jprivera44/EscalAItion.git
```

3. Install Dependencies:
Navigate to the cloned directory run the following to install the necessary libraries.
